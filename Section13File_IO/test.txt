Hello from Pythonfantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. In your world you can create anything you desire.

See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.

We don't want to set these clouds on fire. What the devil. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. You're meant to have fun in life.

If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Anything you want to do you can do here. Every time you practice, you learn more. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.

Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.

Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.

Don't fight it, use what happens. You can get away with a lot. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. We can fix anything.
